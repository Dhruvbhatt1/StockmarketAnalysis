# High-Level Architecture

## Data Ingestion & Streaming
- **Source**: Real-time stock market tick data from an API.
- **Azure Event Hubs**: Ingest and stream JSON-formatted market data events in near real-time.

## Storage & Lakehouse Architecture
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS)**: A central, cost-effective, and scalable data lake for both raw and structured data.
- **Delta Lake (on Databricks)**: Provides transactional capabilities (ACID compliance), schema evolution, and time-travel queries, enabling a robust Lakehouse architecture.

## ETL & Data Transformation
- **Databricks Structured Streaming**: Continuously process and transform streaming data from Event Hubs.
- **Delta Live Tables**: Implement data quality checks, schema validation, and maintain clean, reliable data pipelines.

## Analytics & Visualization
- **Aggregations & Metrics**: Compute moving averages, daily trading volumes, and volatility measures within Databricks.
- **BI Integration**: Connect curated Delta tables to visualization tools like Power BI or Azure Synapse for interactive dashboards and real-time insights.

## Orchestration & CI/CD
- **Azure Data Factory or Databricks Workflows**: Schedule and orchestrate both batch and streaming ETL processes.
- **GitHub Actions**: Implement CI/CD pipelines for:
  - Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform.
  - Automated deployment and testing of Databricks jobs and notebooks.
  - Continuous integration to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Security & Governance
- **Azure RBAC**: Apply role-based access control to secure resources and control access at a granular level.
- **Databricks Secret Scopes & Azure Key Vault**: Securely store and manage sensitive credentials (API keys, tokens) and securely access them within Databricks notebooks and jobs.
